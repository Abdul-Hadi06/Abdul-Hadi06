# Creative Coding Portfolio

Hi, I’m **Abdul Hadi** and this repository collects all the sketches I created for the Creative Coding module. Every folder is a separate experiment written in p5.js.


## Projects

1. **Basic Car** - A basic p5.js animation featuring a car smoothly driving across a night-time scene.
2. **Flower Colorization** - An interactive flower sketch where clicking changes its color.
3. **Flower Animation** - A glowing flower with animated petals created using trigonometric functions and Bézier curves.
4. **Make Your Own Alien** - Generates a random alien with unique features each time using shapes and colors.
5. **Pixel Data** - Manipulates pixel colours of a sunrise image.
6. **Pointillism Effect** - Re-paints a picture using moving coloured dots.
7. **Posterize Effect** - Reduces an image to a small set of poster colours.
8. **Generative Pattern** - Mouse-controlled ripple pattern on a grid.
9. **Interactive Typography** - Floating words that change when you click them.
10. **Interactive Mouse Trails** - Colourful trails follow the cursor across a starry sky.
11. **Audio Visualization** - Bars, circles and waveforms that moves with any type of voice.
12. **Data Visualization** - Growing bars that show continent population data.
13. **Welcome to Bath Spa University - Interactive Art** - Animated welcome screen with stars, waves and interactive text.
14. **Interactive Art** - Interactive sketch reacting to mouse movement and clicks.
